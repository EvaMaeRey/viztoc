viztoc (visual table of contents) is for creating a visual summaries,
especially of flipbooks or xaringan slides. viztoc includes a variety of
strategies for previewing slide contents. In the html setting, a viztoc
might be a gif, still, or still that becomes a gif if you hover over it
– then ideally, you can click through to the full flipbook/slideshow,
or to the relevant page in the flipbook from the table of contents.

  - You can see one style of the “visual table of contents” here:
    <https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#7>
    (the stills)

  - And another here:
    <https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about> (stills to
    gifs upon mouse over) - (this variety only collects the images
    produced by xaringan).

  - Then, the entire slides as frames in gif:
